On the way to making my own dotfiles refering to other dotfiles.

This also include setting file for settings environnment.

Make more efficient shell script and understand dotfiles structure.

```
chmod +x ~/dotfiles/macOX/homebrew_install.sh
chmod +x ~/dotfiles/macOX/install.sh
```

```
~/dotfiles/macOX/homebrew_install.sh
~/dotfiles/macOX/install.sh
```
